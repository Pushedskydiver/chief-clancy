# @chief-clancy/dev

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#267](https://github.com/Pushedskydiver/chief-clancy/pull/267) [`a65c3ee`](https://github.com/Pushedskydiver/chief-clancy/commit/a65c3ee46515b5339f1d1d1e24ed1103e6798e99) Thanks [@Pushedskydiver](https://github.com/Pushedskydiver)! - Cross-package uninstall commands. Each standalone package now ships its own uninstall (`/clancy:uninstall-brief`, `/clancy:uninstall-plan`, `/clancy:uninstall-dev`). Terminal's uninstall renamed to `/clancy:uninstall-terminal` with package-aware detection — checks VERSION markers, warns about standalone packages before proceeding, and provides reinstall guidance.

## 0.1.0

All package READMEs standardised with consistent monorepo section, credits, and license. Terminal bumped to pick up dev 0.1.0 dependency.
